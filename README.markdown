----------

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, ABMExpandingTableViewCells will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
